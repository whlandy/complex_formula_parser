# complex_formula_parser

The goal is to address the fact that flutter does not currently have a parser that specializes in solving complex equations.

This is a simple demo mainly for 2x2 complex matrix calculation, but you also can only fill in "S11"s of these two matrix to get results of a complex formula, and there are some parts not that prefect.

Hope you guys find questions and offer your precious advice to me in the issues area or e-mail me. 

By the way, the sdk version is based on 3.7.7.

Always stay hungry, stay foolish!
